## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Create First Admin

```sql
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role) 
VALUES ('your-user-id-here', 'admin');
```

### Step 2: Test the Flow
1. **Submit an item** (as regular user) → goes to "pending"
2. **Login as admin** → go to `/admin`
3. **Approve the item** → now appears in public listings
4. **Claim the item** (as different user) → goes to claims queue
5. **Review claim** (as admin) → approve/reject

### Step 3: Customize
- All colors follow your theme (maroon primary)
- Sidebar is collapsible
- Mobile-responsive
- Ready for production!
